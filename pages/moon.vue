        <h1>Moon phases</h1>
        <p>Hi there! The moon has different shapes in the sky and we call those shapes "phases". Imagine you have a ball,
            and
            you shine a flashlight on it. When you look at the ball from different angles, you can see different parts of
            it.
            That's kind of like how the moon works.</p>
